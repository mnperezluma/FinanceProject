# S&P 500 - Analysis

First of all, the main idea of this project is establish an analysis about the development of the S&P 500 index through the last 20 years.
I used BeatifulSoup library to extract the necessary data from Wikipedia.
I have Worked with Pandas and YahooFinance API, to perform proper analysis related to daily returns and specific industries.
Moreover, I have implemented data visualisations with MatPlotlib, to examine the direct relationship between VIX and S&P500 from 2017 to 2021.
Finally, I developed a matrix correlation table using SeaBorn, to evaluate assets performance from a recommended investment portfolio.
